# JDBC_LibraryManagementSystem
A JDBC project using Netbeans IDE (Java) and MySQL

## Instructions

-Softwares used: 
Netbeans 11.0, 
Java JDK 13.0.0, 
MySQL 8.0.18. 
(I recommend downloading the latest versions for all.)

-Create the database (the MySQL code for the tables has been provided in the library_test_table_info.sql file.)

-Create a Java Maven project.

-Connect the database with Netbeans using the services pane and add the dependency code from pom.xml to your project's pom.xml file to automatically download the required .jar files when you run the test file (LibTest3.java). (Please be aware of the latest version of MySQL. You can find the appropriate driver dependency code from the web link in the pom.xml file in this repository.)

-Use Netbeans Drag and Drop (JFrame Form of Swing GUI) to create the GUI and just add the functionality code in the auto-generated functions.

-The code that I have provided has: 
checks against the entering of blank fields in the database, 
case checks for username and password, 
protection against SQL injection attacks.

-Lastly, have patience while doing this project, you will learn a lot of fundamentals. The connectivity and other stuff can be very frustrating, but you have to keep your patience and go through that. Don't be demoralized if it doesn't work. You can always contact me (e-mail: harshgkapadia@gmail.com or Twitter: @harshgkapadia or Instagram: @harshk0606) or your seniors for help. All the best! ( :

PS: Please do let me know if anything is faulty or not working in the code. Also, I will accept pull requests if some functionality is added or if bugs are removed.

PPS: If you want a simpler and less complicated (obviously with lesser functionality and no SQL injection attack/blank field input checks), then you can check out my 'JDBC_AirlineManagementSystem' repo. If you have sufficient time, I would recommend going through this project and making your own project using this repo itself. Try not to copy the entire project as it is.
